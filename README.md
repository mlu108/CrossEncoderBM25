## üîß TransformerLens Modifications

This codebase is built on top of a customized version of [`TransformerLens`](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), with additional changes to support **activation patching in a retrieval setting**.

Modifications were made to support the retrieval model:

### üîÅ Modified Files:
1. `load_from_pretrained.py`: sets up necessary configs  
2. `components.py`: customized model components  
3. `HookedEncoder.py`: supports patching and token-level caching

### üß™ Model Usage Example

```python
pre_trained_model_name = "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2"
tokenizer, tl_model, pooler_layer, dropout_layer, classifier_layer = load_tokenizer_and_models(pre_trained_model_name, device)

tokenized_query_doc = tokenizer([query], [original_doc], return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)

outputs, cache = tl_model.run_with_cache(
    tokenized_query_doc["input_ids"],
    return_type="embeddings",
    one_zero_attention_mask=tokenized_query_doc["attention_mask"],
    token_type_ids=tokenized_query_doc["token_type_ids"]
)
```


## üìö Diagnostic Datasets

We conduct activation patching experiments on several diagnostic datasets:
 ‚Ä¢ tfc1: tfc1_add_baseline_final_dd_append_corpus.json
 ‚Ä¢ stmc1: stmc1_add_append_final_dd_corpus.json
 ‚Ä¢ lnc1: used with experiment_lnc2.py
 ‚Ä¢ tfc2: additional variant of tfc1



## Activation & Path Patching (IR Model)

We adapt activation patching and path patching for use with cross-encoder retrieval models.
