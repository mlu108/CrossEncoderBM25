## 🔧 TransformerLens Modifications

This codebase is built on top of a customized version of [`TransformerLens`](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), we modify some parts to perform path/activation patching in a retrieval setting for Cross-Ecndoer.

Modifications were made to support the retrieval model:

### Modified Files:
1. `load_from_pretrained.py`: sets up necessary configs  
2. `components.py`: customized model components  
3. `HookedEncoder.py`: supports patching and token-level caching

### Model Usage Example

```python
pre_trained_model_name = "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2"
tokenizer, tl_model, pooler_layer, dropout_layer, classifier_layer = load_tokenizer_and_models(pre_trained_model_name, device)

tokenized_query_doc = tokenizer([query], [original_doc], return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)

outputs, cache = tl_model.run_with_cache(
    tokenized_query_doc["input_ids"],
    return_type="embeddings",
    one_zero_attention_mask=tokenized_query_doc["attention_mask"],
    token_type_ids=tokenized_query_doc["token_type_ids"]
)
```


## Diagnostic Datasets

We conduct activation patching experiments on several diagnostic datasets:

 • tfc1: tfc1_add_baseline_final_dd_append_corpus.json
 
 • stmc1: stmc1_add_append_final_dd_corpus.json
 
 • lnc1: used with experiment_lnc2.py
 
 • tfc2: additional variant of tfc1



## Activation & Path Patching (IR Model)

We adapt activation patching and path patching for use with cross-encoder retrieval models.

Demo Notebook
 • crossencoder_demo_patching.ipynb: walkthrough of patching procedures on a cross-encoder model.

Helper Scripts

 • Patching_helpers.py: implements key patching routines
 
 • helpers.py: utilities for processing and visualization


## Controllable IR and Downstream Experiments

 • model_editing_SVD_corr.py: replicates experiments using SVD-based vector editing
 
 • forbidden.py: analyzes and blocks specific token contributions



## Linear Approximation Experiments

(Note: Some scripts listed here are not yet uploaded)

 • paper_graphs2.py: reproduces results for Section X (WIP)
 
 • BM_rerank_all.py: performs BM25-style re-ranking with approximated features (WIP)
